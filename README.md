# Computer Graphics Challenges

## What it is?

A collection of computer graphics-related projects ideas. Intended for bored programmers looking for a small side project, and for people interested in learning more about the computer graphics in general.

Each project consists of a series of steps designed to guide you through the implementation process. The steps also include images and/or videos presenting the desired end result.

## What it isn't?

Tutorials. There are much better and much more detailed tutorials and articles covering the topics presented here than I could ever create. I will guide you on _what_ to implement, not _how_ to implement it line by line. You are encouraged to search online for in-depth resources, sample implementations, or to read more about the topics at hand.

## How does it work

Each project is split into a number of smaller steps, representing incremental progress towards a complete project. Most steps are accompanied by images and/or videos showcasing the expected end result, along with a list of keywords that can be used to search for online resources.

If you find yourself stuck, example solutions for all steps are available as a reference.

Additionally, most projects include a "Next steps" section outlining potential improvements and new features if you wish to further develop your project.

## Recommended language/framework

I recommend using [Processing](https://processing.org/). It works on all major operating systems, has modes for Python, Java and JavaScript, and it allows you to start writing graphical apps with a minimal setup.

With that being said, you are free to use any language and tools that you prefer. You don't need advanced 2D or 3D capabilities; most projects simply require you to draw single pixels with a specified color.
